Byte-level byte-pair encoding.

This module is the tokenizer the Lecture 1 notes describe. The training loop
has been removed for you to write. Everything else is complete and working.

Read the notes before starting. They describe the algorithm in full and trace
three merges on their own sentence; the tests in tests/test_tokenizer.py check
a different hand-traced corpus (hug, pug, pun, bun, hugs).

           exactly one token. If ordinary text could merge its way into the
